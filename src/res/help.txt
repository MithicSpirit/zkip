Usage: {[cmd]s} [&] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  cd _      Resolve directory to change to
  init      Print POSIX shell configuration
  query _   Search for a directory
  visit _   Increment a directory

If [&] is provided, the command is executed in the background. This is useless
for commands that do not have side effects. An error is emitted (to stderr) if
the command attempts to produce output (to stdout).
